# DTG - a Daggerheart system for Foundry VTT.
### Goals
- To provide a highly customizable and homebrew friendly version of Daggerheart
- To not go mad in the process.
- To not tie down this project to any specific, prohibitive or spreading license.
- To lean how to do this kind of thing.
### Disclaimers
I used AI as a glorified search engine, in the pursuit of not only knowing what changes in javascript from IE7 bygone era to now, but also to achieve the lofty goal of sleeping more than 4 hours every other day.
